# `Samsung Notes` **android app** in reactjs

## This is the first app of my career written in reactjs. Learned a ton. Browser storage, folder structure, refactoring, redux and many many more things which can be learned only by doing a project by oneself, not by doing any course.

## If I have time I will be reiterating the project inshallah with these features in mind-
### A small rewrite in 17/03/2019   
 - [ ] Make it responsive  
 - [ ] Make it work on cross browsers  
 - [ ] Reiterate the design  
 - [x] Rearrange the folder strucuture
 - [x] Store notes in a good way
