# `Google Keep React` A clone of Google Keep using ReactJS

## My first app ever. Written in reactjs. Learned a ton. Browser storage, folder structure, refactoring, redux and many many more things which can be learned only by doing a real project.

## If I have time I will be reiterating the project with these features in mind -
 - [ ] Make it responsive  
 - [ ] Make it work on cross browsers  
 - [ ] Reiterate the design  
 - [x] Rearrange the folder strucuture
 - [x] Store notes in a good way
